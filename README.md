# Salvaging

Basic notifications and UI for semi-AFK salvaging with the new Sailing skill.

## UI
- The UI will show up above the chat box when you are near a salvageable shipwreck, it will also show when your cargo is full of salvage.

## Notifications
- There are 4 notifications that you can turn on or off, they all default to on.
  - "Crew Start Salvage Notification", which will notify you when any of your NPC crewmates start salvaging, including when a shipwreck becomes available.
  - "Crew Stop Salvage Notification", Similar to above but when the crewmates stop salvaging. This is useful for knowing when there are no active shipwrecks in range.
  - "Player Stop Salvage Notification", Notifies when the player has stopped salvaging, this could be due to a full inventory, active shipwrecked changed or really anything
  - "Player Stop Sorting Notification", this will alert you when you are finished sorting salvage, so you can prepare the next inventory
